I'm an Informatics Engineering student with a strong foundation in logical thinking, analytical problem-solving, and a deep curiosity for how technology can improve human life. My journey began in Medicine, where I developed a sharp attention to detail and a strong sense of responsibility—skills I now apply in the world of software development.

Currently, I’m building my backend development skills with Python and JavaScript, exploring areas like APIs, databases, and clean architecture, while learning to write maintainable and scalable code. I enjoy tackling complex problems and translating them into clear, efficient solutions.

I'm seeking opportunities where I can grow as a developer, collaborate in diverse teams, and contribute to projects that have real-world impact. I'm constantly learning, whether through coursework, self-driven projects, or online resources, and I'm excited to continue evolving both personally and professionally.
